# Travel Information

This page provides some useful tips for traveling around the world. To start with, this page provides airport lounge information of the airports I've traveled recently


## Beijing Capital International Airport [posted on Nov. 13, 2010]

I was using terminal 3 of this airport for flying from Beijing to Bangkok with Air China. With my Star alliance gold membership, I was able to check in at the business class check-in counter of Air China. And I was able to use both First lounge and Business lounge of Air China. Accorging to the person at the reception of First class lounge, the food in the First Class louge is better than the Business class lounge.

From the airport, the city center is a bit far away. So you need to take a cab to reach the center of Beijing. Just get the public taxi with meters, and never ask for non-meter taxis. You do not have to rely on the transportation service provided by the Information Center (that costs 350 RMB) since the taxi drivers with meter are usually very kind and never ask fo tips though they will appreciate if you provide some tips to them. The approximate cost for reaching the central by taxi is 100 RMB.


## Geneva Airport [posted on Feb. 26, 2012]

I've used the one world lounge, but I prefer the one from swiss airline in this airport.
This lounge is cozy, but it is small and it does not provide meal, though it provides snacks. 

I've also used the Swiss airline lounge before. Though that place was also small, it had a small supper including soup. I prefer this one. One more information: though confirmation is needed, the star alliance can provide better convenience to users in this airport, from the viewpoint of location of the gate, and also from the viewpoint of passport control. I do not remember any passport control for star alliance flights though there exist that for one world flights.

I've flown with Finnair flight(sold as Jal flight).
With the one world Emerald status, the boarding pass has a note "PRIORITY SECURITY" on it.
With the boarding pass, I was able to use the priority lane of the security check.
Note that the check-in counter for this flight was a bit confusing.
The counter was opened around 2 hours before the departure.
There are only business class, economy class, and baggage drop counters, and none of them has the notion of one world status.
However, I was able to use the business class check-in counter.


## Narita Airport, Terminal 1 (ANA) [posted on Nov. 1, 2010]

I believe we can check-in anytime in the day of our travel and may enjoy the ANA lounge from early in the morning with the star alliance gold membership (through my experience of flying with ANA/SAS). 

The airport also has United Airlines Lounge, which looks more classic, but I rather prefer ANA/SAS simply because of the style of shower room.

## Narita Airport, Terminal 2 (JAL) [posted on Feb. 26, 2012]

This airport has Sakura Lounge for the JAL premium members. For me, the lounge is something I can recommend. I've got an impression that the lounge is good for value; it provides a good buffet dinner and 10-mimutes free massage, which are something enjoyable, though not prestigious or luxuary. I like it very much. 

## New Ark Airport [posted on Feb. 25, 2012]

I am currently at the Continental airline lounge. To be honest, the quality of lounge here is not that high. There are desks with snacks and coffee. Nevertheless, there exist free Internet access here. 

## Incheon Airport [posted on Nov. 1, 2010]

I believe we can check-in anytime in the day of our travel and may enjoy the Asiana lounge from early in the morning with the star alliance gold membership (through my expericence of flying with Asiana)


## Hiroshima Airport [posted on Nov. 1, 2010]

When flying with ANA, we can check in only 2 hours before the departure time of your flight. Though there is an ANA lounge inside, we need to use the Visa Gold Lounge before the check-in.


## London Heathrow Airport [posted on Feb. 26, 2012]

I've used the BA lounge in Terminal 5. That place is fine and enjoyable. It has small buffet. Though it does not provide big meal (compared to Sakura lounge in Narita), it was good enough for a supper. 

## Taiwan Taoyuan Airport [posted on Nov. 1, 2010]

Though I do not have clear memory, in my understanding, we can check in anytime in the day of our travel and may enjoy the EVA Lounge from early in the morning with the star alliance gold membership (through my experience of flying with ANA)


## Vancouver Airport [posted on Aug. 2012]

As a Star alliance gold member (ana superflyer), i was able to enjoy two benefits here. One is the lounge offered by Aiir Canada while the other is fast security check. The lounge provides decent food with decent drinks. You could expect some supper there. Regarding fast security check, air canada's web didn't say that star alliance members are eligible or not, but I was able to use that. I think that is thanks to a seal (YVR seal) given by the premium checkin counter.

## Vilnius Airport [posted on Arp. 2012]

As a Saphire member of one world (JAL Saphire member), I was able to use a business check-in counter, and Finnaire lounge (after security check). However, I have to say that the lounge is not the best. They offer basic facilities, including chairs and desks, snacks and drinks. It seems to be that there is a free-wifi throughout the airport, but I was not able to get a connection to the Internet at that time.


## Washington Airport [posted on Jul. 2012]

As a Star alliance gold member (ana superflyer), I was able to use the business checkin counter and lounge. It seems to be that the airport had a fast security check lane, but I was not allowed to use that this time. The lounge seems to be connected with the gate, thus I guess customers can get on board directly from the lounge, though I should confirm that in the future.
